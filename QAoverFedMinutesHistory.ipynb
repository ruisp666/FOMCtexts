some forecasters see a business slow down or recession in 1967. housing is in a slump, the capital boom is moderating, and consumers appear more hesitant. but the question is basically whether we are in a pause, or about to take a definite and cumulative turn downward. the growth in business spending for fixed investment and for inventories will doubtless be slower in 1967. on the other hand, we may expect a revival in residential construction. in any analysis of the economic outlook defense spending is a vital factor ; indeed it is now a major factor. although we will have to wait a week or so before we see the president's budget message it i, reasonable to assume that in the coming year there wil1 be a substantial increase in such expenditures over last year. with continued over - all investment demand and high government spending, a continued uptrend in consumer spending seems likely. it seems to us, on balance, that in 1967 as a whole an excessive expansion in demand is a greater danger than recession. in this connection, i note that the staff's analysis concentrated on the early part of the year. although food prices have declined recently, the consumer has seen a persistent rise in the prices of nonfood commodities and especially of services. labor cost per unit of output has been rising, and despite the relative stability of wholesale prices during the last couple of - 30 -\", metadata={'source': 'Minutes/fomchistmin19670110.pdf', 'page': 29}), Document(page_content=\"8 / 13 / 68 1966 was marked by wide gyrations in consumer spending, with consumption expenditures rising at a 9 per cent annual rate in the first quarter, dropping to a 3 per cent growth rate in the second quarter, rising 7 per cent in the third quarter, and then falling back to 4 per cent in the traumatic fourth quarter. growth in consumption was more stable, although slower, throughout 1967, but 1968 seemed to start off with a resumption of the see - saw pattern of 1966. an extraordinary surge in spending in the first quarter was followed by a sharp drop - off in the second. does the resurgence of sales in july mark a return to a full quarter of upswing? i hesitate to make a prediction for so volatile a series, but i do think that the odds are against it, at least to the extent that current flows of income influence spending decisions. we are likely to be in for a period of sharply reduced rates of gain in disposable income. here the july evidence does supply some support. the employment statistics for july reflect some further modest easing in labor market pressures. this shows up most clearly in the teenage group, where unemployment rates for both june and july were high and where in july large with drawals from the labor force were symptomatic of diminishing job opportunities. weakening in labor demand is also reflected in the very moderate employment growth in manufacturing in july, after allowing for the delay in model change - over in the auto industry, and for the last push in steel production before the settlement. the growth in jobs is beginning to lag significantly behind the growth in the labor force, and even with further withdrawals from the labor market and with possible reductions in the workweek, the unemployment rate should creep up over the months ahead. steel inventory liquidation for the next several months will be a major factor exerting a drag on employment, output, and incomes. in some previous post settlement periods - - most noticeable in 1965 - - developments in steel were swamped by other expansive forces in the economy. for example, the sharp acceleration in defense orders during the summer and fall of 1965 and the continued rise in business capital outlays far outweighed the contraction in steel output. that doesn't seem to be in prospect this year, however, barring a turn for the worse in peace negotiations or an outbreak of - 22 -\", metadata={'source': 'Minutes/fomcmod19680813.pdf', 'page': 21}), Document(page_content='3 / 5 / 68 - 108 for one reason, they had been pointing in different directions. in january, unemployment, retail sales, and housing starts improved ; industrial production, new orders, and personal income were less favorable. for another reason, some of the indicators reflected special circumstances. the decline in the unemployment rate re sulted from a drop in the labor force rather than from an increase in employment ; and personal income rose little compared with december because the earlier month contained large federal pay increases. at the same time, the broader view of 1968 seemed to mr. bopp to have clarified somewhat. it now looked as if the second half would be more vigorous than had been thought. one reason might be the behavior of inventories. although total consumer spending in the next few months would rise considerably simply because of strong increases in income, some adjustment might be necessary in the auto sector. as a result, total inventories might not rise as much as had originally been forecast, thus mitigating any problem of adjust ment in the second half. if that was so, one argument for an over strong first half and a less - strong second half might be less persuasive than before. more important, however, it now seemed almost certain that defense spending would be larger than budgeted. that new outlook for the latter part of the year considerably altered the environment in which monetary policy would be operating, mr. bopp observed. in recent months he had viewed with misgivings the substantial increase in money and credit at a time of rapidly', metadata={'source': 'Minutes/fomcmod19680305.pdf', 'page': 107})]\n"

      "Based on the summary of economic projections from the FOMC meeting held on September 15-16, 2020, meeting participants expected to continue assessing realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee's maximum-employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective when determining the stance of monetary policy. They revised up their economic outlook due to the stronger-than-expected rebound in economic activity over recent months, but remained attentive to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to contain it. Almost all participants projected that real GDP would contract in 2020, but would grow faster than their estimates of its longer-run normal growth rate from 2021 to 2023. They projected that the unemployment rate would decline gradually during the forecast period, with a full economic recovery taking some time. Therefore, it can be inferred that the views on monetary policy during 2021 will likely be determined by the evolution of the economy relative to the committee's objectives and the effects of the ongoing pandemic on economic activity, inflation, and employment.\n"

These included such factors as the mix of fiscal and monetary policy, the stubbornly high savings rate, the uncertain trend of federal spending for defense and other purposes, the upward movement of prices, and the interaction of those and other variables on spending and investing decisions. Despite such uncertainties, the group forecast remained highly optimistic for the near term. The median forecasts of the production index and gross national product were considerably higher than last fall, with a strong upward thrust in the first half and a more moderate advance in the second half. For 1968 as a whole, industrial production was expected to average 165, a 4 - 1/2 per cent increase over 1967; and GNP was expected to amount to $845 billion, a 7 - 1/2 per cent advance, with an undesirably large portion of the GNP increase accounted for by rising prices. The quarterly increments of GNP expected during the year were $19 billion, $16 billion, $10 billion, and $13 billion, for the respective quarters.\\n\\nPolitical developments discussed in the meeting include President Johnson's weekend message, the decision to close the London gold market, and the decision to hold an international conference in Washington over the weekend. The gold losses and concern about the international financial system generated an atmosphere of market uncertainty, and expectations of an increase in the discount rate were widespread, with the market appearing to have pretty well discounted a full 1 point increase in that rate. With an actual discount rate increase of 1/2 point announced that evening, the markets breathed a sigh of relief.\""
